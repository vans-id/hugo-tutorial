You don’t need to sacrifice anything!!!

That is what the whole world is telling you. You deserve this. This should be given to you. 

While that would be great! It is also complete B.S.(Blue Skies).

Years ago, Kim and I set a goal to exit the Rat Race and enjoy true freedom.

We worked hard. We learned everything we could from people who had done the things we wanted to.

And we sacrificed short-term ‘wants’ for our ultimate goal.

We did not sacrifice important things like love or family. We sacrificed short-term ‘wants’. We sacrificed watching television. Going to bars, and we would have been sacrificing social media time if it was around.

But… and here is the important part… it was worth it!

Through the years, we have helped many Rich Dad followers also achieve this goal. Our office is filled with letters from people celebrating their freedom with us.

I know many of you are on that same journey right now. Some of you are close, others are just starting.

Whatever your level of progress is, supporting you on your journey out of the Rat Race is one of my greatest desires.
